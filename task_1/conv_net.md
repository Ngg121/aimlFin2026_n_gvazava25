A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model primarily designed for processing structured grid-like data such as images, time series, and network traffic matrices. CNNs are especially powerful for feature extraction because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of patterns through convolution operations.

Unlike traditional neural networks, CNNs preserve spatial relationships by using local connections and shared weights. This makes them computationally efficient and highly effective for pattern recognition tasks.
